# Multimodal Data Integration for Predictive Modelling of Measles Vaccine Response  
**Thesis: Cross-Vaccine Marker Validation**

### Overview  
This thesis explores the **integration of multiple data types** to build predictive models for 
understanding how individuals respond to the **measles vaccine**, with a focus on **cross-vaccine marker validation**. 
By leveraging machine learning techniques, the study aims to create models that can predict vaccine 
responses accurately, and validate these predictions using data from other vaccines.

### Key Components

#### **1. Multimodal Data Integration**  
Combining diverse types of data to form a comprehensive view of the biological landscape. These data types include:
- **Immune system responses** (e.g., cytokine levels, antibody titers)
- **Clinical information**

#### **2. Predictive Modelling**  
The integrated data is used to train a machine learning model that predicts how individuals will respond to the 
measles vaccine. The possible outcomes include:
- **Strong immune response**
- **Mild immune response**
- **No immune response**

The goal is to accurately predict these outcomes and identify biological markers that drive the response.

#### **3. Cross-Vaccine Marker Validation**  
To ensure the model's robustness, **validation** is performed using **data from other vaccines** 
(e.g., Hepatitis B vaccines). If markers such as **cytokines** or **antibodies** are effective predictors 
for measles vaccine response, this validation step checks whether they are also reliable for other vaccines.

### The Goal

The primary objective is to build a **predictive model** that can:
- Accurately **forecast vaccine response** using multimodal data.
- Validate key **immune markers** across different vaccines, ensuring that they are generalizable and robust.

This research can help in **personalizing vaccination strategies**, **improving vaccine effectiveness**, 
and identifying individuals who may need adjusted vaccine dosages or additional booster shots.

---

This work not only enhances our understanding of **vaccine responses** but also pushes forward the potential 
for personalized immunology and more efficient global vaccination efforts.
